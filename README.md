# Irista-v2

Canon (the camera brand) used to support a cloud photo storage service called 'Irista'.

While it had its quirks, I loved the site and how simple and clean it was compared to other similar services like Google Photos.
About a month after I signed up for Irista, Canon announced that it was closing down the site, and I've been wanting to rebuild it as a personal project ever since.

This site is a personal project meant to mimic the layout and functionality of the original Irista site using Cloudinary as the backend storage solution. 

Work in Progress... readme will be updated when site is live.
