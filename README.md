## About the Project: 
Canon (the camera brand) used to support a cloud photo storage service called 'Irista'.

While it had its quirks, I loved the site and how simple and clean it was compared to other similar services like Google Photos.  Although Google Photos has cool features like facial recognition and auto album creation, it does not allow for nested folders which drove me bonkers, because I could not keep my photos organized by year and then month, which is how I have them stored locally. 

About a month after I signed up for Irista, Canon announced that it was closing down the site, and I've been wanting to rebuild it as a personal project ever since.

This site is a personal project meant to mimic the UI layout and functionality of the original Irista site using Cloudinary as the backend storage solution. 

## View the Project: 

It is currently hosted on Heroku to support a full-stack React/Node application, but since Heroku will be discontinuing their free tier, this site will be moving in the near future.  

It is login-protected because I wanted practice with how to set it up, but don't feel like you have to create a login for it. 
I'll add some short gifs of the functionality below (soon) to demonstrate the site without needing to log in for it. 

## Site Demo 

Coming Soon!
